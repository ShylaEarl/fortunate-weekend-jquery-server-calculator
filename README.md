# Project Name

jQuery Server Side Calculator

## Description

Duration: Weekend Challenge

This project allows a user to input two numerical values and execute a mathmatical operation. The total of the current mathmatical operation is displayed on the browser along with a history of all calculations created. 

The problem solved by this project is mathmatical calculation. This project solves this problem by allowing the user to create multiple mathmatical calculations by inputing two numbers and selecting an operator to produce the desired calculation.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

<!-- ## Installation  -->

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

    1. User inputs a number
    2. User selects a mathmatical operator
    3. User selects a second number
    4. User clicks the '=' button to generate the calculation total which appears below the first value input box. A calculation history including all elements of the equation will also populate below the total. 
    5. User then clicks the 'C' button to clear the input feilds.
    6. Wash, rinse, repeat steps 1-5.

## Built With

    1. jQuery
    2. Node.js
